# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector using supervised machine learning techniques in Python. By analyzing customer behavior and demographic data, the model helps identify customers likely to leave the bank, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## 📌 Objective

To build a predictive model that accurately classifies whether a customer is likely to churn based on their historical and demographic data.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** 🐍
  - `Pandas`, `NumPy` for data preprocessing
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` for data visualization
  - `Scikit-learn` for modeling and evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and model development

## 🔍 Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and relationships
- Feature engineering for improving model performance
- Comparison of multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Results

- Achieved high accuracy and balanced recall/precision with optimized model
- Identified key drivers of churn such as tenure, credit score, and balance
- Enabled business insights to reduce churn rates
